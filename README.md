# docs
This is a folder that contains my own documentation about tools, concepts or other notes, etc.
The documentation is organized by programming languages, and each folder contains files with a nomenclature indicating [1]-[2], where:
- [1]: It is "Language" if it's the language, or "Framework_Name" for example "Django" or "Library_Name", for example "Numpy".
- [2]: Title of the documentation.
